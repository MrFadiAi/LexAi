4.  **Load Unpacked:**
    *   Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
    *   Navigate to the folder where you saved the LexAi files (the folder containing `manifest.json`).

    *   Click "**Accept**" to replace your original selected text with the suggestion.
    *   Click "**Reject**" to close the popup without changes.
    *   Click the suggestion text itself to edit it manually, then click "**Accept Edit**".
2.  **Reply Generation:**
    *   Select the text of the post/message you want to reply to (e.g., the main text of a tweet).
